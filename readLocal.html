<h1>Javascript Can Read Local Files</h1>

<p>Please turn on the console in your browser
and study readLocal.js to see the effects
of various pieces of javascript code
for reading a local file.

<p>Notice that in firefox when opening this .html
as file:///... , callbacks for $.get() is not executed
but the data is read anyway, with some delay.
Therefore with some appropriate amount of delay,
you can begin to process the data
in window.setTimeout()'s callback.
